# piholeList

This project is developed because I had a mountian of block lists for pihole. These lists
would sometimes stop being managed, or removed all together. This list compiles all the domains
I use into one place so it can be maintained for all to use. 

# Credit
For all the lists that were used is given in the .txt file and eventually migrated here to 
consolodate the .txt file.
